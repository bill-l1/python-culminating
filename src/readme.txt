INSTRUCTIONS:

Go to the checkout and wait for the customer. When they appear, a text bubble will pop up showing 
their order.

Look in the recipe book (top right corner) to see which bones are needed.

In the Moulding room, buy dust on the left side.

Fill the moulds on the right side by dragging dust from your inventory into them.

Once they have the correct amount, click them again to add that bone to your inventory.

Repeat until you have the necessary amount and types.

In the Animatron room, drag the bones from your inventory to the correct slots
(as shown in the recipe book).

Click slots with bones in them to rotate, or remove them if they've been clicked enough.

Click the lightning icon to create the skeleton.

If it was successful, the new skeleton should appear in the slot on the top bar.

At the Checkout Room, drag the skeleton to the customer to fill their order.

Repeat until the customer's order is complete.

GOALS:

After a customer's order is complete, they will give you money depending on the difficulty 
of the order. Your business rating also becomes higher.

If they become impatient (patience bar goes to 0), the customer will leave and the rating
of your business becomes lower.

The difficulty of the orders start to increase as your rating goes higher, which means
the reward for completing them become higher as well.

Every 15~ seconds you will be forced to pay the lease for your business. The timer and the
amount due is shown in the bottom right corner. You will have to pay more money as time
goes on.

The goal of the game is to finish orders as fast as possible, as so that your money does not
ever go below 0, or your rating goes below 0.
